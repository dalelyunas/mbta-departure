The project is an MBTA departure board built using Flask and React.

It displays data from the MBTA v3 API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `yarn start:server`

Starts the flask server using pipenv.
The site can then be visited at localhost:5000

Make sure you build before running the server so the build directory is available for the server to serve to users.
